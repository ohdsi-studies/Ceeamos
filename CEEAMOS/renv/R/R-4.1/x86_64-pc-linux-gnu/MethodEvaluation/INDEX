createReferenceSetCohorts
                        Create cohorts used in a reference set.
euadrReferenceSet       The EU-ADR reference set A reference set of 43
                        drug-outcome pairs where we believe the drug
                        causes the outcome ( positive controls) and 50
                        drug-outcome pairs where we believe the drug
                        does not cause the outcome (negative controls).
                        The controls involve 10 health outcomes of
                        interest. Note that originally, there was an
                        additional positive control (Nimesulide and
                        acute liver injury), but Nimesulide is not in
                        RxNorm, and is not available in many countries.

ohdsiDevelopmentNegativeControls
                        The OHDSI Development Set - Negative Controls A
                        set of 76 negative control outcomes, all for
                        the exposures of ACE inhibitors (compared to
                        thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics). This
                        set is a much small set than the he OHDSI
                        Method Evaluation Benchmark, but follows the
                        same principles. It is intended to be used when
                        developing methods, leaving the Methods
                        Benchark untouched until a final evaluation of
                        the method, thus preventing 'training' on the
                        evaluation set. The negative controls are
                        borrowed from the LEGEND Hypertension study.
                        The exposure, outcome, and nesting cohorts can
                        be created using the
                        'createReferenceSetCohorts' function. These
                        negative controls can form the basis to
                        generate positive controls using the
                        'injectSignals' function.
ohdsiNegativeControls   The OHDSI Method Evaluation Benchmark -
                        Negative Controls A set of 200 negative
                        controls, centered around four outcomes of
                        interest (acute pancreatitis, GI bleeding,
                        Stroke, and IBD), and 4 exposures of interest
                        (diclofenac, ciprofloxacin, metformin, and
                        sertraline), which 25 negative controls each.
                        Each drug-outcome pair also includes a
                        comparator drug (where the comparator is also a
                        negative control), allowing for evaluation of
                        comparative effect estimation, and a nesting
                        cohort for evaluating methods such as the
                        nested case-control design. The exposure,
                        outcome, and nesting cohorts can be created
                        using the 'createReferenceSetCohorts' function.
                        These negative controls can form the basis to
                        generate positive controls using the
                        'injectSignals' function.
omopReferenceSet        The OMOP reference set A reference set of 165
                        drug-outcome pairs where we believe the drug
                        causes the outcome ( positive controls) and 234
                        drug-outcome pairs where we believe the drug
                        does not cause the outcome (negative controls).
                        The controls involve 4 health outcomes of
                        interest: acute liver injury, acute kidney
                        injury, acute myocardial infarction, and GI
                        bleeding.
